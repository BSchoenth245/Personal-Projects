This is a shell script that I have written which allows me to make a backup copy of my school files onto an external hardrive.

The names of the files and directories are hard-coded into the code, but the files are checked and trasferred from a function call that needs the name of the file on my personal machine, as well as the target directory on the external hard drive.
