This is a shell script that I have written which allows me to make a backup copy of my school files
onto an external hardrive.

Everything is hard-coded, so I need to go in and change the name of the classes, but I have plans to
control this using positional parameters, as well as making the script more concise by writing it into
a function, rather than be as expanded as it is currently.
